# Chapter 4: Settings

In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of Background Scripts in managing communication and data in the `fusenlink` project. Now, let's explore the concept of Settings.

### Settings: Customizing Extension Configurations

Settings utility in `fusenlink` allows users to manage configuration options, persisting their preferences locally. This feature enables users to personalize their experience with the extension.

### Key Concepts:
1. **getSettings()**: Retrieves the current extension settings.
2. **updateSettings(settingsPatch)**: Updates extension settings with new values.

Suppose you want to customize the maximum number of invites to send and the delay between actions. Let's see how to interact with settings.

### How to Use Settings
To retrieve current settings:

```javascript
getSettings().then((settings) => {
  console.log("Current settings:", settings);
});
```

To update settings with new values:

```javascript
updateSettings({ maxInvites: 20, delayMs: 500 }).then((response) => {
  console.log("Settings updated:", response);
});
```

### Internal Implementation Overview:

When requesting settings through `getSettings()`, a message is sent to the Background Script that retrieves the settings. Similarly, `updateSettings()` sends a message to update the settings.

For a detailed understanding of the implementation, refer to the `lib/settings.js` file.

In the next chapter, we will explore Messaging, which handles communication between different parts of the extension seamlessly. Proceed to [Chapter 5: Messaging](05_messaging.md) for more insights into managing communication efficiently.
